# react-blockly

[![Built on Blockly](https://tinyurl.com/built-on-blockly)](https://github.com/google/blockly)

A React component that embeds a [Blockly](https://developers.google.com/blockly/) visual programming editor.

This is a continuation of PatientsLikeMe's [react-blockly-component](https://github.com/patientslikeme/react-blockly-component) project.  This new version utilizes Google's official Blockly npm packages in addition to other modernizations.

Features:

* Supports an `xmlDidChange` prop so other components can easily consume the XML generated by the editor
* Generates the toolbox XML from a `toolboxCategories` or `toolboxBlocks` prop, and automatically notifies Blockly when it's been updated

## Example usage

[FernandoVazZ](https://github.com/FernandoVazZ) has made an example React app that shows how to set up react-blockly as well as how to create custom blocks for use in it: https://github.com/FernandoVazZ/reactblockly-customblocks/

Thanks so much Fernando!

## Help wanted!

I wrote react-blockly for an internal tool when I worked at PatientsLikeMe, Inc.  I no longer maintain this tool, and I don't even have access to it anymore.  I also don't have any actual project that uses react-blockly anymore.

I'd love to find maintainers for this package who actually use it.  In particular, some things I would love to have help with are:

* A test suite
* Switching over to the newer JSON-based toolbox format that Blockly now supports
* Seeing if we can remove immutable.js as a dependency
* Modernizing the components, potentially moving away from class components and towards publicly-exposed hooks and function components
* TypeScript typings

If you are interested in working on any of those things, please [let me know](mailto:natbudin@gmail.com)!  Additionally, if you're interested in taking over maintainership of this package entirely, I'd be happy to talk to you about that.

## Installation

To add react-blockly to a React app that uses npm, run:

```bash
npm install --save react-blockly
```

To add react-blockly to a React app that uses yarn, run:

```bash
yarn add react-blockly
```

## How to use

write `import ReactBlockly from 'react-blockly';` in your code and use ReactBlockly as a component.

You could also import one of these component:
  ```
  BlocklyEditor,
  BlocklyToolbox,
  BlocklyToolboxBlock,
  BlocklyToolboxCategory,
  BlocklyWorkspace
  ```
using `import { BlocklyToolbox } from 'react-blockly'`(or another component name)


## Developer setup for working on this package

Clone this repository, and then inside it, do:

```bash
yarn install
yarn run start
```

webpack-dev-server will start and will be serving a demo of react-blockly, which should automatically refresh if you change the code locally.

## Building the source locally

Clone this repository, and then inside it, do:

```bash
yarn install
yarn run build
```

You'll get a `dist` directory containing the compiled JS file and a source map.

## Properties

All properties are optional except where otherwise specified.

* `initialXml`: The XML of the program to initially load in the editor.
* `workspaceConfiguration`: Any configuration options to be passed into `Blockly.inject` (except for `toolbox`, which is handled automatically).
* `wrapperDivClassName`: The value for the `class` attribute to be used on the `<div>` elements generated by this component.  Typically you'll need to use this to set the height of the Blockly editor, using either an explicit `height` style, flexboxes, or some other means.
* `toolboxCategories`: An array of categories for the toolbox.  Each category is an object including the following properties:
  * `name`: The display name of this category.
  * `custom`: The value for the `custom` attribute of this category (can be either `"VARIABLE"` or `"PROCEDURE"`).
  * `categories`: An array of subcategories, each of which follows the same format as this object.
  * `blocks`: An array of blocks to appear in the category.  Each block is an object including the following properties:
    * `type` (required): The Blockly type name for the block (such as `"controls_if"` or `"logic_compare"`).
    * `colour`: If present, gives a custom colour value for the block.
    * `shadow`: True if this is a shadow block; false or undefined otherwise.
    * `fields`: An object mapping from field names to pre-set values for those fields.
    * `values`: An object mapping from value input names to pre-set connected blocks for those value inputs.  Each block is an object following the same format as this one.
    * `statements`: An object mapping from statement input names to pre-set connected blocks for those statement inputs.  Each block is an object following the same format as this one.
    * `next`: The next block connected to this one, which is an object following the same format as this one.
    * `mutation`: An object specifying the content of the `<mutation>` tag for this block, with the following properties:
      * `attributes`: An object mapping from attribute names to values for those attributes.
      * `innerContent`: The XML content of the `<mutation>` tag in string format.
* `toolboxBlocks`: An array of top-level blocks for the toolbox.  Each block is an object following the format of the objects in the `toolboxCategories` `blocks` array (specified above).  If this property is defined, `toolboxCategories` should not be defined, since Blockly's toolbox can either contain blocks or categories, but not both.
* `workspaceDidChange`: A callback function that will be fired for every workspace event. Take a look at https://developers.google.com/blockly/guides/configure/web/events for a full list of events. For example you can handle your clientside code generation in this function. The new workspace object will be passed as an argument to the function.
* `processToolboxCategory`: A callback function that can be used to pre-process the content of a toolbox category.  This function is passed a single object (an [Immutable.js](https://facebook.github.io/immutable-js/) Map) from the `toolboxCategories` array and is expected to return an object of the same format.  This is useful if another React component is embedding `BlocklyEditor` and wants to add dynamic content to the toolbox.

## Example usage

See `public/index.html` and `src/dev-index.jsx` for a fairly full-fledged demo that shows off most of the features of this component.
